 - <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a1664cb-8f49-447f-8377-d3b5e8b8426e" width="25"> Fun fact: Because of my passion for sports, I once sustained several injuries, including a torn ACL, MCL, a ruptured meniscus, and even a bone fragment fracture.
  (After a year of believing all these injuries had been treated, my doctor informed me that only the ACL reconstruction was performed — the other injuries were never operated on, as the MRI report had overestimated the severity of the ruptures.
  When the doctor explained it to me, I didn’t fully understand it at the time. )

    <p>When I had to choose my graduation subjects in high school, I had no idea what might interest me. I thought for a long time about what I could focus on. I knew, since I was at a grammar school, that I didn't do well in subjects that required a lot of memorization, like biology or civic education. I've always been more inclined toward logical thinking, although I never excelled in math.</p>
    <p>By process of elimination, I chose computer science and mathematics. Computer science became my greatest interest when COVID hit. Since many people weren't studying, I helped my entire class with programming assignments, and that's when I learned most about programming in Python. That's when I really fell in love with programming, although my true passion has always been sports, but I wasn't lucky in that area.</p>
    <p>So, I decided to pursue what I was best at in high school, and that was computer science. Now, I am studying Computer Science at Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STU) in Bratislava. I'm still struggling with all the math courses, but I know I can handle it. Even though I haven't graduated yet, I'm confident that I made the best decision to study IT.</p>
